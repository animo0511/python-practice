# we use while to set a loop 
# we make uasually 'i' for variable of while

i = 1
while i <= 10:
 print("I am a student !") # it is continue ultimately because we command where to stop the loop

 i = 1
 while i <= 10:
  print("I am Student !!") # in this we set to make i to increase by 1  when one print is applied and when i is 10 then the loop breaks
  i = i + 1
